# Purpose

This repository is part of the [Hobby Hoster](https://github.com/skamensky/hobby-hoster) project.

This particular repo is specifically tailored for hosting a Netdata monitoring solution. Netdata is an open-source tool designed for IT infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting. It provides real-time insights into everything happening on the system it runs on, including web servers, databases, and applications.

This monitoring solution can be hosted on any server configured within the Hobby Hoster project, providing detailed performance and health monitoring for all hosted applications and services.


This site is hosted at [monitoring.kelev.dev](https://monitoring.kelev.dev/), but is protected by a password and therefore unavailable to the public.
